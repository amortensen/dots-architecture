                DDoS Open Threat Signaling Requirements
                    draft-ietf-dots-requirements-00

Abstract

   This document describes an architecture for establishing and
   maintaining DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) within and between
   networks.  The document makes no attempt to suggest protocols or
   protocol extensions, instead focusing on architectural relationships,
   components and concepts used in a DOTS deployment, as well as
   obstacles confronting a network operator looking to enable DOTS.

1.  Introduction

   Signaling the need for help defending against an active distributed
   denial of service (DDoS) attack requires a common understanding of
   mechanisms and roles among the parties coordinating attack response.
   The proposed signaling layer and supplementary messaging is the focus
   of DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DDoS).  DOTS proposes to standardize a
   method of coordinating defensive measures among willing peers to
   mitigate attacks quickly and efficiently.

   This document describes an architecture used in establishing,
   maintaining or terminating a DOTS relationship in a network or
   between networks.  DOTS enables hybrid attack responses, coordinated
   locally at or near the target of an active attack, as well as closer
   to attack sources in the network path.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Scope

   This document defines an architecture for the proposed DOTS standard
   in the IETF.

   In this architecture, DOTS clients and servers communicate using the
   signaling mechanism established in the proposed DOTS standard.  As a
   result of signals from a DOTS client, the DOTS server may modify the
   network path of traffic destined for the attack target or targets,
   for example by diverting traffic to a scrubbing center.  Packets
   deemed part of an active attack may be dropped.

   The architecture presented here is assumed to be applicable across
   network administrative domains-as, for example, between an enterprise
   domain and the domain of a third-party attack scrubbing service-as
   well as to a single administrative domain.  DOTS is generally assumed
   to be most effective when aiding coordination of attack response
   between two or more participating network domains, but single domain
   scenarios are worth investigating elsewhere.
