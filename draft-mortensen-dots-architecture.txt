                DDoS Open Threat Signaling Architecture
                  draft-mortensen-dots-architecture-00

Abstract

   This document describes an architecture for establishing and
   maintaining DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) within and between
   networks.  The document makes no attempt to suggest protocols or
   protocol extensions, instead focusing on architectural relationships,
   components and concepts used in a DOTS deployment, as well as
   obstacles confronting a network operator looking to enable DOTS.

1.  Introduction

   Signaling the need for help defending against an active distributed
   denial of service (DDoS) attack requires a common understanding of
   mechanisms and roles among the parties coordinating attack response.
   The proposed signaling layer and supplementary messaging is the focus
   of DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DDoS).  DOTS proposes to standardize a
   method of coordinating defensive measures among willing peers to
   mitigate attacks quickly and efficiently.

   This document describes an architecture used in establishing,
   maintaining or terminating a DOTS relationship in a network or
   between networks.  DOTS enables hybrid attack responses, coordinated
   locally at or near the target of an active attack, as well as closer
   to attack sources in the network path.

1.1.1.  Key Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.1.2.  Definition of Terms

   The following terms are used to define relationships between
   elements, the data they exchange, and methods of communication among
   them:

   DDoS:  A distributed denial-of-service attack, in which attack
      traffic originates from widely distributed sources.  DDoS attacks
      are intended to cause ai negative impact on the availability of
      servers, services, applications, and/or other functionality of an
      attack target.

   attack target:  the network-enabled service, application, server, or
      some collection thereof, on which a DDoS attack is focused.

   attack telemetry:  collected network traffic characteristics enabling
      detection, classification and possible traceback of a DDoS attack.

   countermeasure:  An action or series of actions undertaken to
      distinguish and filter out DDoS attack traffic from valid traffic
      destined for an attack target.

   mitigation:  A defensive response against a detected DDoS attack,
      performed by an entity in the network path between attack sources
      and the attack target, either through inline deployment or some
      form of traffic diversion, consisting of one or more
      countermeasures.  The form mitigation takes is out of scope for
      this document.

   mitigator:  A network element capable of performing mitigation of a
      detected DDoS attack.

   DOTS client:  A DOTS-aware network element requesting attack response
      coordination with another DOTS-aware element, with the expectation
      that the remote element is capable of helping fend off the attack
      against the client.

   DOTS server:  A DOTS-aware network element handling and responding to
      messages from a DOTS client.  The DOTS server MAY enable
      mitigation on behalf of the DOTS client, if requested, by
      communicating the DOTS client's request to the mitigator and

      relaying any mitigator feedback to the client.  A DOTS server may
      also be a mitigator.

   DOTS relay:  A DOTS-aware network element positioned between a DOTS
      server and a DOTS client.  A DOTS relay receives messages from a
      DOTS client and relays them to a DOTS server, and similarly passes
      messages from the DOTS server to the DOTS client.

   DOTS agents:  A collective term for DOTS clients, servers and relays.

   signal channel:  A bidirectional, mutually authenticated
      communication layer between DOTS agents characterized by
      resilience even in conditions leading to severe packet loss, such
      as a volumetric DDoS attack causing network congestion.

   DOTS signal:  A concise authenticated status/control message
      transmitted between DOTS agents, used to indicate client's need
      for mitigation, as well as to convey the status of any requested
      mitigation.

   heartbeat:  A keep-alive message transmitted between DOTS agents over
      the signal channel, used to measure peer health.  Heartbeat
      functionality is not required to be distinct from signal.

   client signal:  A message sent from a DOTS client to a DOTS server
      over the signal channel, possibly traversing a DOTS relay,
      indicating the DOTS client's need for mitigation, as well as the
      scope of any requested mitigation, optionally including detected
      attack telemetry to supplement server-initiated mitigation.

   server signal:  A message sent from a DOTS server to a DOTS client
      over the signal channel.  Note that a server signal is not a
      response to client signal, but a DOTS server-initiated status
      message sent to the DOTS client, containing information about the
      status of any requested mitigation and its efficacy.

   data channel:  A secure communication layer between client and server
      used for infrequent bulk exchange of data not easily or
      appropriately communicated through the signal channel under attack
      conditions.

   blacklist:  a list of source addresses or prefixes from which traffic
      should be blocked.

   whitelist:  a list of source addresses or prefixes from which traffic
      should always be allowed, regardless of contradictory data gleaned
      in a detected attack.

1.2.  Scope

   This document defines an architecture for the proposed DOTS standard
   in the IETF.

   In this architecture, DOTS clients and servers communicate using the
   signaling mechanism established in the proposed DOTS standard.  As a
   result of signals from a DOTS client, the DOTS server may modify the
   network path of traffic destined for the attack target or targets,
   for example by diverting traffic to a scrubbing center.  Packets
   deemed part of an active attack may be dropped.

   The architecture presented here is assumed to be applicable across
   network administrative domains-as, for example, between an enterprise
   domain and the domain of a third-party attack scrubbing service-as
   well as to a single administrative domain.  DOTS is generally assumed
   to be most effective when aiding coordination of attack response
   between two or more participating network domains, but single domain
   scenarios are worth investigating elsewhere.

1.3.  Assumptions

   This document makes the following assumptions:

   o  The network or networks in which DOTS is deployed are assumed to
      offer the required connectivity between DOTS agents and any
      intermediary network elements, but the architecture imposes no
      additional limitations on the form of connectivity.

   o  There is no universal DDoS attack scale threshold triggering a
      coordinated response across network administrative domains.  A
      network domain administrator, or service or application owner may
      arbitrarily set attack scale threshold triggers, or manually send
      requests for mitigation.

   o  The mitigation capacity of networks requesting [AM: need def]
      coordinated attack response is opaque to any network receiving and
      potentially agreeing to intervene.

   o  The mitigation capacity of networks receiving requests for
      coordinated attack response is opaque to the network sending the
      request.  The network receiving the DOTS client signal may or may
      not have sufficient capacity to filter all or even the majority of
      DDoS attack traffic directed at a target.

   o  DOTS client and server signals, as well as messages sent through
      the data channel, are sent across any transit networks with the
      same probability of delivery of any other traffic between the DOTS

      client network and the DOTS server network.  Any encapsulation
      required for successful delivery is left untouched by transit
      network elements.

   o  The architecture allows for, but does not assume, the presence of
      Quality of Service (QoS) policy agreements between DOTS-enabled
      peer networks aimed at ensuring delivery of DOTS signals between
      DOTS agents.
