    <abstract>


<t>This document describes an architecture for establishing and maintaining
DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) within and between networks. The document
makes no attempt to suggest protocols or protocol extensions, instead focusing
on architectural relationships, components and concepts used in a DOTS
deployment, as well as obstacles confronting a network operator looking to
enable DOTS.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>Signaling the need for help defending against an active distributed denial
of service (DDoS) attack requires a common understanding of mechanisms and
roles among the parties coordinating attack response. The proposed signaling
layer and supplementary messaging is the focus of DDoS Open Threat Signaling
(DDoS). DOTS proposes to standardize a method of coordinating defensive
measures among willing peers to mitigate attacks quickly and efficiently.</t>

<t>This document describes an architecture used in establishing, maintaining or
terminating a DOTS relationship in a network or between networks. DOTS
enables hybrid attack responses, coordinated locally at or near the target of
an active attack, as well as closer to attack sources in the network path.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="definition-of-terms" title="Definition of Terms">

<t>The following terms are used to define relationships between elements,
the data they exchange, and methods of communication among them:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='DDoS:'>
  A distributed denial-of-service attack, in which attack traffic originates
from widely distributed sources. DDoS attacks are intended to cause ai
negative impact on the availability of servers, services, applications,
and/or other functionality of an attack target.</t>
  <t hangText='attack target:'>
  the network-enabled service, application, server, or some collection thereof,
on which a DDoS attack is focused.</t>
  <t hangText='attack telemetry:'>
  collected network traffic characteristics enabling detection, classification
and possible traceback of a DDoS attack.</t>
  <t hangText='countermeasure:'>
  An action or series of actions undertaken to distinguish and filter out
DDoS attack traffic from valid traffic destined for an attack target.</t>
  <t hangText='mitigation:'>
  A defensive response against a detected DDoS attack, performed by an entity
in the network path between attack sources and the attack target, either
through inline deployment or some form of traffic diversion, consisting of
one or more countermeasures. The form mitigation takes is out of scope for
this document.</t>
  <t hangText='mitigator:'>
  A network element capable of performing mitigation of a detected DDoS attack.</t>
  <t hangText='DOTS client:'>
  A DOTS-aware network element requesting attack response coordination with
another DOTS-aware element, with the expectation that the remote element is
capable of helping fend off the attack against the client.</t>
  <t hangText='DOTS server:'>
  A DOTS-aware network element handling and responding to messages from a
DOTS client. The DOTS server MAY enable mitigation on behalf of the DOTS
client, if requested, by communicating the DOTS client&rsquo;s request to the
mitigator and relaying any mitigator feedback to the client. A DOTS server
may also be a mitigator.</t>
  <t hangText='DOTS relay:'>
  A DOTS-aware network element positioned between a DOTS server and a DOTS
client. A DOTS relay receives messages from a DOTS client and relays them
to a DOTS server, and similarly passes messages from the DOTS server to the
DOTS client.</t>
  <t hangText='DOTS agents:'>
  A collective term for DOTS clients, servers and relays.</t>
  <t hangText='signal channel:'>
  A bidirectional, mutually authenticated communication layer between DOTS
agents characterized by resilience even in conditions leading to severe
packet loss, such as a volumetric DDoS attack causing network congestion.</t>
  <t hangText='DOTS signal:'>
  A concise authenticated status/control message transmitted between DOTS
agents, used to indicate client&rsquo;s need for mitigation, as well as to convey
the status of any requested mitigation.</t>
  <t hangText='heartbeat:'>
  A keep-alive message transmitted between DOTS agents over the signal channel,
used to measure peer health. Heartbeat functionality is not required to be
distinct from signal.</t>
  <t hangText='client signal:'>
  A message sent from a DOTS client to a DOTS server over the signal channel,
possibly traversing a DOTS relay, indicating the DOTS client&rsquo;s need for
mitigation, as well as the scope of any requested mitigation, optionally
including detected attack telemetry to supplement server-initiated
mitigation.</t>
  <t hangText='server signal:'>
  A message sent from a DOTS server to a DOTS client over the signal channel.
Note that a server signal is not a response to client signal, but a DOTS
server-initiated status message sent to the DOTS client, containing
information about the status of any requested mitigation and its efficacy.</t>
  <t hangText='data channel:'>
  A secure communication layer between client and server used for infrequent
bulk exchange of data not easily or appropriately communicated through the
signal channel under attack conditions.</t>
  <t hangText='blacklist:'>
  a list of source addresses or prefixes from which traffic should be blocked.</t>
  <t hangText='whitelist:'>
  a list of source addresses or prefixes from which traffic should always be
allowed, regardless of contradictory data gleaned in a detected attack.</t>

<section anchor="scope" title="Scope">

<t>This document defines an architecture for the proposed DOTS standard in the
IETF.</t>

<t>In this architecture, DOTS clients and servers communicate using the signaling
mechanism established in the proposed DOTS standard. As a result of signals
from a DOTS client, the DOTS server may modify the network path of traffic
destined for the attack target or targets, for example by diverting traffic
to a scrubbing center. Packets deemed part of an active attack may be dropped.</t>

<t>The architecture presented here is assumed to be applicable across network
administrative domains&ndash;as, for example, between an enterprise domain and
the domain of a third-party attack scrubbing service&ndash;as well as to a single
administrative domain. DOTS is generally assumed to be most effective when
aiding coordination of attack response between two or more participating
network domains, but single domain scenarios are worth investigating elsewhere.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="assumptions" title="Assumptions">

<t>This document makes the following assumptions:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The network or networks in which DOTS is deployed are assumed to offer
the required connectivity between DOTS agents and any intermediary network
elements, but the architecture imposes no additional limitations on the
form of connectivity.</t>
  <t>There is no universal DDoS attack scale threshold triggering a coordinated
response across network administrative domains. A network domain
administrator, or service or application owner may arbitrarily set attack
scale threshold triggers, or manually send requests for mitigation.</t>
  <t>The mitigation capacity of networks requesting [AM: need def] coordinated
attack response is opaque to any network receiving and potentially agreeing
to intervene.</t>
  <t>The mitigation capacity of networks receiving requests for coordinated
attack response is opaque to the network sending the request. The network
receiving the DOTS client signal may or may not have sufficient capacity to
filter all or even the majority of DDoS attack traffic directed at a target.</t>
  <t>DOTS client and server signals, as well as messages sent through the data
channel, are sent across any transit networks with the same probability of
delivery of any other traffic between the DOTS client network and the DOTS
server network. Any encapsulation required for successful delivery is left
untouched by transit network elements.</t>
  <t>The architecture allows for, but does not assume, the presence of Quality of
Service (QoS) policy agreements between DOTS-enabled peer networks aimed at
ensuring delivery of DOTS signals between DOTS agents.</t>
